# Real-Time LLM Streaming and Document Q&A System - Question Description

## Overview

Build a comprehensive real-time streaming system that provides live document processing and AI-powered question answering through WebSocket connections. This project focuses on creating responsive, interactive AI applications with real-time document upload, processing, vector search, and streaming AI responses for enhanced user experience.

## Project Objectives

1. **Real-Time WebSocket Communication:** Master WebSocket protocols for bidirectional real-time communication between clients and servers with proper connection management and message handling.

2. **Streaming Document Processing:** Implement live document processing pipelines that provide real-time progress updates during file upload, text extraction, and indexing operations.

3. **Vector Search Integration:** Build efficient vector search systems using FAISS and sentence transformers for semantic document retrieval and context-aware question answering.

4. **Live AI Response Streaming:** Create streaming AI response systems that provide real-time text generation with proper context integration and response formatting.

5. **Multi-Client Architecture:** Design systems that can handle multiple concurrent WebSocket connections with proper client management and resource sharing.

6. **Interactive User Experience:** Build responsive user interfaces that provide immediate feedback during document processing and AI interactions.

## Key Features to Implement

- WebSocket server architecture supporting multiple concurrent clients with proper connection lifecycle management
- Real-time document upload and processing with live progress streaming and status updates
- Vector search system using sentence transformers and FAISS for semantic document retrieval
- Streaming AI response generation with context integration from document search results
- Multi-format document support including PDF and text files with appropriate processing pipelines
- Client management system with connection tracking, error handling, and graceful disconnection handling

## Challenges and Learning Points

- **WebSocket Programming:** Understanding WebSocket protocols, connection management, message serialization, and real-time communication patterns
- **Streaming Data Processing:** Implementing efficient streaming pipelines that provide real-time feedback without blocking operations
- **Vector Search Implementation:** Learning semantic search concepts, embedding generation, and efficient similarity search algorithms
- **Real-Time AI Integration:** Building responsive AI systems that stream responses while maintaining context and conversation flow
- **Concurrent Connection Management:** Handling multiple simultaneous connections with proper resource management and error isolation
- **User Experience Design:** Creating responsive interfaces that provide immediate feedback and maintain engagement during processing
- **Error Handling and Recovery:** Building robust systems that handle connection failures, processing errors, and service interruptions gracefully

## Expected Outcome

You will create a production-ready real-time streaming system that demonstrates advanced WebSocket programming, document processing, and AI integration. The system will provide an interactive, responsive user experience for document-based AI applications.

## Additional Considerations
